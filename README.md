Here is the python code written by Aziza Satkhozhina and myself for use in the processing and analysis of longitudinal biomarker health data.

This is my first time using GitHub so I am sure this could be organized in a neater fashion, but this is my best attempt at sorting the files. Dolphin code is in the main branch while the kidney and dog files are in their own respective branches called 'kidney' and 'dog'.
